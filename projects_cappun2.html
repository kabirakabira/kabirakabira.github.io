                The Deterrent Effect Revisited: A Study of the Effects of Capital Punishment on Violent Crime Rates in
                the U.S.

                Exactly one year after finishing my initial study on the existence of the deterrent effect of capital
                punishment on violent crimes and homicides, I completed my revised study on the same topic. In this
                revised study, I aim to isolate the existence of a short-term deterrent effect. I do this by looking at
                state-level crime data from three weeks before to three weeks after every execution in the United
                States. It has already been established by many researchers before me that capital punishment does not
                cause any long term, or continuous, deterrent effect on violent crimes and homicides. So, it is possible
                that there is a short-term deterrent effect that occurs after each instance of capital punishment is
                enforced, and that this effect is short-lived. Therefore, my study makes a significant contribution to
                the existing literature on the topic.

                There are several adjustments in this study that make it more accurate than the one I did a year ago.
                The first of those is the fact that in this study, I look at individual executions and a few weeks
                before and after each of those. In the earlier study, I looked at annual state-level crime data before
                and after they abolished the death penalty. By making this adjustment, I limited the potential
                endogeneity and reverse causation that were introduced in my first study (linked at the bottom of the
                page). Secondly, I analyze the question at a daily level, which is much more granular than the annual
                level I used in the earlier study, allowing a comprehensive study of the short-term deterrent effect.
                Lastly, I use two separate identification strategies: a difference-in-differences model as well as a
                regression discontinuity model.

                From my study, I could conclude that there is no evidence of the existence of any sort of short-term
                deterrent effect of capital punishment on violent crime. Because the National Research Council refuses
                to accept current statistical evidence on the lack of significance of the deterrent effect, my paper
                makes the policy suggestion of placing the policy on a moratorium, such as California, Pennsylvania, and
                Oregon have already done.
