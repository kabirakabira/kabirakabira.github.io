        <p class="card-desc"> I drew a custom version of the map from Pokemon Emerald and made it interactive using the Leaflet library in JS.
          This project was a way for me to combine my professional interests (mapping and spatial visualization) with my personal interests, 
        and proved to be a fun exercise in learning Javascript. </p>

          I built an RShiny dashboard that allows users to explore Chicago's neighborhoods and take a look at some publicly available data including
        demographics, crime statistics, transit routes, and more. </p>

        stakeholder interviews to identify reasons for and indicators of gentrification in 
        the neighborhood. </p>

      <p class="card-date">07/2024</p>
      <p class="card-desc">I tested the capability of logistic, knn and random forest classification models to be able
        to predict a census tract's designation as a Qualified Opportunity Zone based on 2015 American Community Survey
        data. Spoiler: The models didn't do too well, but it was a fun learning experience. It also revealed that not
        all States followed similar guidelines when nominating Census Tracts for QOZ designation.</p>

      <p class="card-date">08/2023</p>
      <p class="card-desc">Pulling American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau is unnecessarily
        convoluted and time-consuming, especially if you don't have experience with APIs. Needing to pull multiple
        years or geographies exponentially modifies the required time and effort. Yet, it's something researchers need
        to do for nearly every project. Using the Census API, I created a front-end application that allows users to
        pull multiple selected variables for multiple geographies at the same time.</p>

      <p class="card-desc">For some projects, Census geographies (counties, tracts, etc) might not be
        optimal. This application takes a user-inputted point (XY coordinates) and pulls a set of demographic data for
        the area within a specified walk or drive time. This application uses the OSRM library to create an isochrone,
        then intersects the isochrone with Census tracts and pulls and summarizes demographic data for the area
        covered by the isochrone. The data can be downloaded as a geopackage.</p>

          economic base, and improve quality of life and provide more equal access to opportunity for all of its residents.</p>

      <p class="card-desc">I revisited my earlier project on the same topic, with an updated methodology and 
        research design. With this design, I utilize individual executions in U.S. States as
        an exogenous shock to crime rates and implement a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy as well as 
        a regression discontinuity (RD) strategy. In line with previous research in this field, I found that capital
        punishmnent does not have any discernible effect on violent crime rates.</p>
