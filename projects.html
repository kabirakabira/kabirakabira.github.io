      <p class="card-date">09/2024</p>
      <p class="card-desc">  During the Fall '24 semester at UIC, I prepared this memorandum on Pilsen as a 
        part of the course UPP 501: Space, Place, and Institutions. This memorandum looks at
        the history, demographics, and physical structure of the Lower West Side and incorporates
        stakeholder interviews to identify reasons for and indicators of gentrification in 
        the neighborhood. </p>

      <p class="card-date">07/2024</p>
      <p class="card-desc">I tested the capability of logistic, knn and random forest classification models to be able
        to predict a census tract's designation as a Qualified Opportunity Zone based on 2015 American Community Survey
        data. Spoiler: The models didn't do too well, but it was a fun learning experience. It also revealed that not
        all States followed similar guidelines when nominating Census Tracts for QOZ designation.</p>

      <p class="card-date">08/2023</p>
      <p class="card-desc">Pulling American Community Survey data from the Census Bureau is unnecessarily
        convoluted and time-consuming, especially if you don't have experience with APIs. Needing to pull multiple
        years or geographies exponentially modifies the required time and effort. Yet, it's something researchers need
        to do for nearly every project. Using the Census API, I created a front-end application that allows users to
        pull multiple selected variables for multiple geographies at the same time.</p>

      <p class="card-desc">For some projects, Census geographies (counties, tracts, etc) might not be
        optimal. This application takes a user-inputted point (XY coordinates) and pulls a set of demographic data for
        the area within a specified walk or drive time. This application uses the OSRM library to create an isochrone,
        then intersects the isochrone with Census tracts and pulls and summarizes demographic data for the area
        covered by the isochrone. The data can be downloaded as a geopackage.</p>

        membership / plan (such as through ESRI), but this is free.</p>

        <p class="card-desc">Region 1 PDC engaged AECOM in July of 2021 to help the PDC craft an economic recovery roadmap  
          for the Region's six diverse member counties. The purpose of this roadmap is to provide actionable tools and 
          strategies for the PDC and its stakeholder organizations to help move the region towards a more resilient, diverse, stable 
          economic base, and improve quality of life and provide more equal access to opportunity for all of its residents.</p>
          <p class="card-desc"> As an analyst on this project, I worked on the industry cluster and market analysis, mapping services and 
            infrastructure, and assisted in the process of turning these findings into actionable strategies. </p>

      <p class="card-desc">I revisited my earlier project on the same topic, with an updated methodology and 
        research design. With this design, I utilize individual executions in U.S. States as
        an exogenous shock to crime rates and implement a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy as well as 
        a regression discontinuity (RD) strategy. In line with previous research in this field, I found that capital
        punishmnent does not have any discernible effect on violent crime rates.</p>
